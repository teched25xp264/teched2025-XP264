# Exercise 2 - Use External Scalers. Keda - the Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaler.

## Exercise 2.0 - Introduction to kubernetes autoscalers

> [!NOTE]
>
> KEDA, an open-source initiative that facilitates event-driven autoscaling for Kubernetes workloads, was originally developed by Microsoft and Red Hat. It has since become a sandbox project under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). KEDA focuses on autoscaling applications in response to events sourced from a variety of platforms, including Kafka, RabbitMQ, and cloud-specific services such as Azure Service Bus and Google Pub/Sub.

> [!NOTE]
>
> KEDA ushers in a new era of flexibility and efficiency in autoscaling. It enhances Kubernetes' capacity to support fine-grained autoscaling for event-driven workloads. Leveraging KEDA, you can dynamically scale your deployments from zero to any arbitrary number, contingent on the volume of events they are designed to process.

## Exercise 2.1 - HPA

- Have your Function with the replicas value set to 1 to prevent the internal Serverless HPA creation.


https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/#support-for-horizontalpodautoscaler-in-kubectl  

https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#autoscale  

- step1:
Initially deployed serveless python 3.12 function with a single replica....  
As shown below, no HPA in place yet:  

> [!NOTE]
>```rust
>kubectl get hpa faas-srv  -n xp264-050 --kubeconfig ~/.kube/kubeconfig-<shoot_id>.yaml
>```
> `Error from server (NotFound): horizontalpodautoscalers.autoscaling "faas-srv" not found`


- step2:
Scale-out to 5 replicas 

> [!NOTE]
>```rust
> kubectl autoscale function faas-srv  -n xp264-050 --cpu-percent=50 --min=5 --max=10 --kubeconfig ~/.kube/kubeconfig-<shoot_id>.yaml
>```
> `horizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/faas-srv autoscaled`


- step3:  

After a little while the HPA will be up and running:  

> [!NOTE]
>```rust
> kubectl get hpa faas-srv  -n xp264-050 --kubeconfig ~/.kube/kubeconfig-<shoot_id>.yaml                                             
> NAME       REFERENCE           TARGETS              MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE
> faas-srv   Function/faas-srv   cpu: <unknown>/50%   5         10        0          11s
>```
>```rust
> kubectl get hpa faas-srv  -n xp264-050 --kubeconfig ~/.kube/kubeconfig-<shoot_id>.yaml
> NAME       REFERENCE           TARGETS       MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE
> faas-srv   Function/faas-srv   cpu: 3%/50%   5         10        5          93s
>```

- step4:
scale down from 5 to 2 replicas by editiong the `horizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/faas-srv` resource

```
kubectl edit hpa faas-srv  -n xp264-050 --kubeconfig ~/.kube/kubeconfig-<shoot_id>.yaml
horizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/faas-srv edited
```

- step5:
scale back to a single replica. how this is to be done ?

In order to scale down from 2 or 5 replicas to 1 replica just remove the HPA resource?

- 
What about scaling down to zero ?



## Exercise 2.2 - KEDA

After completing these steps you will have...

- remove the HPA autoscaler

```
kubectl delete hpa faas-srv  -n xp264-050 --kubeconfig ~/.kube/kubeconfig-<shoot_id>.yaml
horizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling "faas-srv" deleted

```

## Exercise 2.3 - KEDA's Cron-Based Scaler

KEDA offers a broad range of scaling strategies, one of which is the **cron-based scaler**. This scaler allows you to schedule scaling actions according to the time of day, an invaluable feature for managing predictable fluctuations in workload.

As an illustration, the cron-based scaler enables you to:

- **Manage High Traffic and Request Volume Peaks**: With the cron-based scaler, you can program your applications to upscale during peak hours or high-traffic events, such as Black Friday or New Year sales. The same functionality can be used to schedule your applications to upscale during off-peak hours for batch processing tasks.


<table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; background-color: #f5f5f5;" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr style="height: 193px;">
<td style="width: 71.6%; height: 193px;">
<div>
<h1><a href="https://url.sap/53tot3"><img class="aligncenter" src="images/keda-scale-bf.png" alt="before" height="600"/></a></h1>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

- **Optimize Resource Utilization and Reduce Expenses**: The cron-based scaler offers a solution to optimize resource utilization and reduce costs by allowing you to schedule your applications to downscale during non-working hours. This feature is useful for your **dev/stage/QA** clusters, which are not required during off-working hours.

> [!NOTE]
>
> This benefits when your workloads require more resources than the base setup. The [current base setup](https://kyma-project.github.io/price-calculator/) consists of 3 VMs, each with 4 CPU and 16 GB of RAM. Therefore, if your workloads need 4 or more VMs to be provisioned, this feature can provide benefits to control costs and keep them to base setup during off-work hours.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The cron scheduling is applicable only to customer workloads and **not to kyma components**.
